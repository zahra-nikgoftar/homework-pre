You are provided with an Application component that represents a job application form. Your task is to write a test that ensures the component renders correctly. Specifically, you need to:

1. Verify that the headings, input fields, and form elements (e.g., textboxes, combobox, checkbox) are rendered.

2. Use appropriate queries from React Testing Library, such as getByRole, getByLabelText, getByPlaceholderText, and getByAltText, to check for the presence of these elements.
