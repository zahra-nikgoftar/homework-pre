## Async/Await Testing (e.g., delayPromise):

Jest provides two ways to handle asynchronous operations in tests:

1. **Using `async/await`:** Write your tests using `async/await` syntax to mirror the asynchronous behavior of the function.

2. **Using Jest's asynchronous testing features:** Jest offers functions like `done` and `return` to handle asynchronous operations within tests. Refer to Jest documentation for detailed usage.

3. **Write Tests:** Create tests for the function using `expect` and matchers. Verify the function behaves as expected with the delays for 1000 milliseconds or higher. hint: `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual()`

Remember to choose the approach that best suits your testing style and the complexity of your asynchronous function.

## Mocking External Dependencies and Async/Await Testing in Jest

This section explains how to handle external dependencies and asynchronous functions in your Jest tests.

### Mocking External Dependencies (e.g., fetchUserData):

1. **Identify the Function:** Locate the function that interacts with the external dependency (like `fetchUserData`).
2. **Mock the Dependency:** Use Jest's `jest.mock` function to replace the actual dependency with a mock implementation. This mock can control the data returned by the dependency.
3. **Create Mocked Data:** Define the data you want the mock to return when the function interacts with it.
4. **Write Tests:** Create tests for the function using `expect` and matchers. Verify the function behaves as expected with the mocked data.
