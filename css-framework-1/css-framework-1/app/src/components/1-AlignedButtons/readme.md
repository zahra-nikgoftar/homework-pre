### Align Buttons

In this component, you should use two MUI components:

1. Button
2. Stack

We want to align three buttons horizontally using the Stack component and its props.
Hint: If you don't know what props this component accepts, you can check the component API section in MUI.

Use additional props for the Stack component to create space between the buttons.

We have three types of buttons in MUI: `text`, `contained` and `outlined`. Use all of them.

- The first button should be disabled if we click on it.
- The second one should have a user icon at the start of the button (use the button's props to implement this).
- The third one should navigate to an external website when we click on it.

Use the `color` prop to change the color of each button to anything you want.

# note:

All buttons should have below styles
paddingY: 0.5rem
paddingX: 2rem

after all you should use 3 components of MUI not 2, do not forget the مزلوم icon component :)
