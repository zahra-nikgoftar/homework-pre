# Counter app

Let's create a simple react app using vite

you have to make a simple click counter app that whenever you click on increase button, the number in the page increases, when you click on decrease it decreases and when you click on reset, the number becomes 0

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

Using the useState hook in react, we can declare and initialize state variables. In this case it is count.

then you should use events just like this on the buttons you have

```jsx
onClick={() => setCount((count) => "functionality here"}
```
