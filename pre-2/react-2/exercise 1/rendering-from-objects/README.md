# Rendering from objects

Let's say we have the following JS object containing a customer's information:

```js
const customer = {
  first_name: "Bob",
  last_name: "Dylan",
};
```

## Instructions:

create `CustomerInformation` componet and write the necessary code to make your file render the following output into the website:

```jsx
<div>
  <h1>My name is Bob</h1>
  <h2>My last name is Dylan</h2>
</div>
```
