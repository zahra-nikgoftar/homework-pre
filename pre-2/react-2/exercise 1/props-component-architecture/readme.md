Create a pokemon application (a pokedex) that displays an interface that looks like this:

To create the pokedex, you should use 2 components, a `Pokedex` component and a `Pokecard` component. The `Pokedex` should be the parent component and it will create 5 `Pokecard` components for each pokemon that will be shown.

The application should use `Props` to get the data for the pokedex. Here is the data for the `Props`:
